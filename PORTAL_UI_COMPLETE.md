### 4. Command Integration ✅

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks button (e.g., "Reboot Device")
2. Portal calls `POST /api/pods/[id]/command` with command name
3. Command is saved to database with status "queued"
4. POD polls for commands on next heartbeat (every 60 seconds)
5. POD executes command and reports back
6. Status updates: queued → sent → acknowledged → completed/failed
7. UI refreshes and shows updated command status

**Command Flow:**
```
Admin UI → POST /api/pods/:id/command → Database (queued)
                                            ↓
POD heartbeat → GET /api/pods/:id/command → Retrieves queued commands
                                            ↓
POD executes → PATCH /api/pods/:id/command → Updates status (completed)
                                            ↓
Admin UI (auto-refresh) → Shows completed status
```

---

### 5. Command History Tab ✅

**Features:**
- ✅ Shows all commands sent to POD
- ✅ Status badges (Queued, Sent, Completed, Failed)
- ✅ Timestamp for created/executed/completed
- ✅ Error messages for failed commands
- ✅ Color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Auto-refreshes with page

**Status Colors:**
- 🟡 Yellow: Queued/Sent
- 🟢 Green: Completed
- 🔴 Red: Failed
- 🔵 Blue: Acknowledged

---

### 6. Version Number Display ✅

**POD List Page:**
- ✅ Version badge in table (e.g., "1.0.0")
- ✅ Consistent formatting across all PODs

**POD Detail Page:**
- ✅ Software version in Hardware Info card
- ✅ Model number displayed
- ✅ Can compare versions across PODs

**Future Enhancement Ready:**

---

### 7. Three-Tab Interface ✅

**Cameras Tab:**
- ✅ List of connected cameras
- ✅ Camera status indicators
- ✅ Position/location information
- ✅ Last recording timestamp

**Recent Detections Tab:**
- ✅ Last 50 detections (24 hours)
- ✅ Plate number
- ✅ Confidence percentage (color-coded)
- ✅ Detection timestamp
- ✅ Camera that detected it

**Command History Tab:**

---

## 🔄 Auto-Refresh Implementation

### POD List Page
**Refresh Interval:** 30 seconds

```typescript
// Auto-refresh functionality
- Polls /api/pods every 30 seconds
- Silent refresh (no loading spinner)
- Updates pods array in state
- Shows "Last updated X ago" timestamp
- Toggle button to enable/disable
- Continues in background tab
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Always shows current status
- ✅ Detects offline PODs within 30 seconds
- ✅ Low overhead (simple GET request)
- ✅ User can disable if needed

---

### POD Detail Page
**Refresh Interval:** 15 seconds

```typescript
// Faster refresh for active monitoring
- Polls /api/pods/[id] every 15 seconds
- Updates all metrics simultaneously
- Refreshes command status
- Shows new detections
- Live toggle button
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Near real-time metrics
- ✅ Quick command status updates
- ✅ Immediate detection visibility
- ✅ Better for active monitoring

---

## 📊 Status Indicators

### Online/Offline Detection

**Logic:**
```typescript
const isOnline = (last_heartbeat) => {
  const minutesSinceHeartbeat =
    (Date.now() - new Date(last_heartbeat)) / 60000;

  return minutesSinceHeartbeat < 5; // Online if heartbeat within 5 min
};
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Green dot** - POD is online (heartbeat < 5 min ago)
- 🔴 **Gray dot** - POD is offline (heartbeat > 5 min ago)
- ⚠️ **Warning** - Commands queued, will execute when online

---

### Metric Color Coding

**CPU Usage:**
- Green: < 70%
- Yellow: 70-85%
- Red: > 85%

**Memory Usage:**
- Green: < 80%
- Yellow: 80-90%
- Red: > 90%

**Disk Usage:**
- Green: < 80%
- Yellow: 80-90%
- Red: > 90%

**Temperature:**
- Green: < 60°C
- Yellow: 60-75°C
- Red: > 75°C

*(Note: Color coding is UI-ready, can be added in next iteration)*
